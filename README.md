# FHIR-NHS-SCHEDULING-API

A generic Scheduling API for use across Health and Social Care. This includes the process of finding free Slots and booking Appointments into those Slots.

## History ##
This was previously called FHIR-A2SI-APPOINTMENTS-API it has been renamed to emphasise that it is not specific to A2SI, and is a more general scheduling API.

### Scope ###
The initial scope that this API is being used in is <a href='https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/uec-appointments/'>NHS 111 to Urgent Treatment Centres</a>, however the FHIR resources etc are being designed in such a way as to make them reusable across as wide a scope as is possible.
