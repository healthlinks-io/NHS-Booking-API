## Introduction ##
This resource is fundamental to the Appointment Booking process, it represents time allocations determined by a Provider organisation which are made available to Consumers. For more clarification see <a href='resources_overview.html#urgent--emergency-care-appointments-apis'>the diagram on the FHIR Resources overview page</a>.

Slots are returned following a <a href='search_free_slots.html'>search for free Slots</a>. The slot is linked to other resources through a referenced Schedule resource.
