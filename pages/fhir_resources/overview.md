## Background ##

- The “disposition” from the patient interaction (NHS111 call etc) determines the urgency (giving the time constraints).
- The DoS (Directory of Services) will have been <a href='process.html#getservices'>searched</a> and an appropriate service for the Patient selected.
- Where the selected service offers appointment Booking, it will include an ASID value.
- The ASID is used <a href='process.html#find-endpoint'>to locate the FHIR endpoint</a> to be queried.
- A FHIR RESTful <a href='search_free_slots.html'>Search request is sent</a> to the FHIR endpoint for Slots that meet the time constraints, the ASID is passed as a constraint on the HealthcareService ID.
- The specified HealthcareService may run zero to many Schedules.
- Each Schedule may contain zero to many Slots.
- The Slots are filtered using the Time constraints before being returned in a <a href='http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/bundle.html#searchset'>searchset Bundle</a>.
