## Use case ##

A system requests a specific appointment from either the registry or a Provider system.
**NB The registry has not yet been delivered.**

## Security ##

- Utilises a JSON Web Token (JWT) to transmit Consumer system identity and authorisation details.
- Is routed through the SSP (Spine secure Proxy)
- Utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authentication.

## Search parameters ##

The registry system supports the following search parameters that MAY be passed to the API:

| Name | Type | Description | Paths |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Patient` | reference | The national service identifier of the Patient for whom Slots are being requested | `Appointment.participant.actor` |

## RESTful Query ##

The request body is sent using an http `GET` method.

The following query demonstrates a full request for information:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
http://[FHIR base URL]/Appointment<br>
?Appointment.participant.actor=https://demographics.spineservices.nhs.uk|1234554321
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Response ##

### Success ###
The Registry:

- WILL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful retrieval of Appointments.
- WILL include the (Zero to Many) `Appointment` resources which meet the requested criteria.
- WILL NOT implement <a href='http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html#paging'>paging as described here</a> to limit the number of resources returned.
- WILL implement a limit such that Appointments in the past will not be returned.

### Failure ###
- If the request fails because either no valid JWT is supplied or the supplied JWT failed validation, the response WILL include a status of `403` **Forbidden**.
This WILL be accompanied by an OperationOutcome resource providing additional detail.

- If the request fails because the query string parameters were invalid or unsupported, the response WILL include a status of `400` **Bad Request**.
- If the request fails because of a server error, the response WILL include a status of `500` **Internal Server Error**.

Failure responses with a `4xx` status SHOULD NOT be retried without taking steps to address the underlying cause of the failure.

Failure responses with a `500` status MAY be retried.

## Response body structure ##
The response body WILL be a FHIR `Bundle` resource containing zero to many Appointment resources, meeting the appropriate profile.

### From the registry ###
Where the request is made against the registry, the resources will contain limited details as defined in <a href='register_an_appointment.html'>Register an Appointment</a>, specifically:
