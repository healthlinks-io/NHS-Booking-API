## Use case ##

A consuming system wishes to cancel an Appointment which was previously <a href='book_an_appointment.html'>booked</a>.

## Security ##

- Utilises a JSON Web Token (JWT) to transmit Consumer system identity and authorisation details.
- Is routed through the SSP (Spine secure Proxy)
- Utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authentication.

## Request ##

The request body is sent using an http `PUT` method.

The body is a valid Appointment resource which conforms to <a href='https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Appointment-1'>the relevant profile</a>. **NB The appointment resource **MUST** be <a href='get_an_appointment.html'>retrieved from the Provider system</a> in order to ensure that no data is lost.**, for full details of the payload body, see the <a href='appointment.html'>Appointment resource details</a>.

- Provider systems **SHOULD** store previous versions of the resource to defend against any such loss of data.
- Provider systems **SHOULD** reject cancellation requests where differences (other than those specified) are detected between the original and updated resource.

## Response ##

### Success ###
Where the request succeeded, the response **MUST** include a status of `200` **OK**.
The response **MUST** include a Location header giving the absolute URL of the created Appointment. This URL **MUST** remain stable, and the resource **SHOULD** support RESTful updates using a PUT request to this URL.
The response body **MUST** include the updated Appointment, this resource **MUST** include the newly assigned id of the resource.

### Failure ###
- If the request fails because of a business rule (for example if differences are detected between the existing and updated Appointment), the response **MUST** include a status of `422` **Unprocessable Entity** <a href='http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.10.1'>as described here</a>.
This **SHOULD** be accompanied by an OperationOutcome resource providing additional detail.
- If the request fails because the request body failed validation against the relevant profiles, the response **MUST** include a status of `422` **Unprocessable Entity** <a href='http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.10.1'>as described here</a>.
This **SHOULD** be accompanied by an OperationOutcome resource providing additional detail.
- If the request fails because either no valid JWT is supplied or the supplied JWT failed validation, the response **MUST** include a status of `403` **Forbidden**.
This **SHOULD** be accompanied by an OperationOutcome resource providing additional detail.

- If the request fails because the request body was simply invalid, the response **MUST** include a status of `400` **Bad Request**.
- If the request fails because of a server error, the response **MUST** include a status of `500` **Internal Server Error**.

Failure responses with a `4xx` status **SHOULD NOT** be retried without taking steps to address the underlying cause of the failure.

Failure responses with a `500` status **MAY** be retried.
