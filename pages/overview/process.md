The interactions are detailed further here:

### GetServices ###
This is existing process, using a CheckCapacitySummary query to the DoS, this is detailed in <a href='https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/dos-api/'>a separate specification</a>.

### Select ###
This is the process of the Consuming system user and the Patient agreeing on the most suitable service, and is outside the scope of this specification.

### Find Endpoint ###
This is the process used in order to find the techncal endpoint (or URL) of the FHIR server to be used in order to book appointments for the selected Service.
This uses two LDAP queries to SDS, using the ASID from the selected DoS Service.

NB: The examples provided here are described against SDS in OpenTest.

The first query is to retrieve the nhsAS Object and takes the form:
```ldap
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://192.168.128.11 -b "ou=services, o=nhs" "(uniqueIdentifier=[ASID-Value])"
```

The response will be something like this:
```
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <ou=services, o=nhs> with scope subtree
# filter: (uniqueIdentifier=918999199203)
# requesting: ALL
#

The important part of the above is the **nhsMHSPartyKey** value.

The second query is to retrieve the nhsMHS object, and takes the form:
```ldap
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://192.168.128.11 -b "ou=services, o=nhs" "(&(nhsMhsPartyKey=[nhsMHSPartyKey goes here])(nhsMhsSvcIA=urn:nhs:names:services:careconnect:fhir:rest:read:slot))"
```

The response will be something like this:

The important part of the above is the **nhsMHSEndPoint** value.

### Get Token ###
This is the process used to create an access token which can be used by the Provider system to verify the identity and assurance status of the Consuming system.

Current implementations of the nationally defined APIs follow the standard process for Spine core APIs as documented here:
https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/spine-core/security_jwt.html. This uses an unsigned token generated by the Consuming system.

The specific process for creating the access token will be implemented per use case; and so develepors must review the guidance in the specific standard for your use case.  For example review the guidance in the UEC Appointment Bookings standard.

### Get Slots ###
This is the process to find availability at the selected service, it is <a href='search_free_slots.html'>described in detail here</a>.

### Select ###
This is the process of the Consuming system user and the Patient agreeing on the most suitable Slot, and is outside the scope of this specification.

### Book ###
This is the process of sending a booked appointment, including details of the Patient and an associated (CDA) document from the Consuming system to the Provider system, and is <a href='book_an_appointment.html'>described in detail here</a>.

## Registering the Appointment ##
As described booked Appointments subsequently need to be<a href='registry.html'>registered in the Registry</a>.
