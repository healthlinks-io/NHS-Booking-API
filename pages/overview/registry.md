# Background #
In order to support the ability for any service to be able to find and subsequently update or cancel an existing Appointment which is booked for a Patient, Appointments will be indexed in a registry. This registry will then support <a href='search_patient_appointments.html'>searching for Appointments for a given Patient</a>, returning an Appointment resource, which has an Identifier that acts as a Pointer to the original Appointment resource. The details of this Appointment resource holding a pointer can be seen on the <a href='appointment.html#key-fhir-elements-for-registering'>descripton of the Appointment resource</a> for registering an Appointment.

## Sequence Diagram ##

The process for registering an Appointment in the Registry is shown below.

### Get Token ###
This is the process used by an assured system to get an access token which can be used by the Registry to verify the identity and assurance status of the calling system.

To retrieve this JWT token, the following fields are POSTed to the **token endpoint**. This is **TBC**

```
POST  HTTP/1.1
Host: {{tokenEndpoint}}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: */*
Host: {TBC}
content-length: 219
Connection: keep-alive

client_id=[see below]
&client_secret=[see below]
&grant_type=client_credentials
&scope=[see below]
```
- `client_id` will be a static value, provided by NHS Digital following assurance.
- `client_secret` will be a static (but will be rotated on a periodic basis) value, provided by NHS Digital following assurance.
- `grant_type` will be a fixed value of `client_credentials`
- `scope` will be the Registry value suffixed with `/.default`

The response to this will be something like:
```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "ext_expires_in": 3600,

Requests to The Registry **MUST** include a http header as below (using the above token as an example) with a Key of Authorization and a value of `Bearer ` + the value in `access_token` from the above response:

| --- | --- |
| Authorization | Bearer eyJ0eXAi... shortened for display ...QHQOqJWU2ToLA |
